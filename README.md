This is a clone of original Severian's server mod with some improvements.
Only works on Bugfixed-HL
		
		* Shotgun reloads much faster than normal.
		* Shotgun shoots much faster than normal.
		* Shotgun damage increased from normal.
		* Crossbow reloads much faster than normal.
		* Crossbow shoots faster than normal.
		* Crowbar, when right-clicked, fires off "Hello!" to nearby players.
		* Snarks, when right-clicked, teleport the player to a random spawn point. This can only be done once every 2 minutes, or once per death (whichever comes quicker!).
		* Snarks also look different and use the 'chumtoad' model.
		* Snarks, when dying, explode and cause area effect damage for 5 points.
		* Hand Grenades, when right-clicked, launch and detonate on impact. You can only do this once every 5 seconds.
		* Tripmines, when right-clicked, will place a 'lightning' mine which will blow up with 150% of the damage of a regular mine.
		* Players have 1 second of spawn protection before they may be shot. They can however, fire immediately upon spawning.
		* Flashlight is much brighter than normal.
		* Map information, remaining time, and fraglimit displayed when you are dead.
		* Identification of players when you aim your crosshair at them, built in.
    	* Infinite ammo for gauss
